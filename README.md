# **Analyzing NHTSA Accident Data**
This project explores the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset published by the NHTSA. 
The aim of this project is to derive insights about traffic fatalities in the US, with an overall focus on how factors such as **restraint use** or **vehicle type** can affect crash outcomes.
While the dataset itself does not include any personally identifiable information, it is derived from individual events, each corresponding to a tragedy that has affected real people. 
This analysis is conducted with respect for those affected, with the hope that the insights gained may contribute to safer driving habits and help prevent future tragedies.

The FARS user manual is located at this link, wherein the manual goes over the various .csv files included, their fields, and changes over the years.

## **Objectives**

- Load, clean, and analyze data for select years
- Analyze relationships between the following and crash outcome:
   - Restraint use
   - Injury severity
   - Occupant type/seating location
   - Vehicle characteristics (eg. weight and class)
- Complete visualizations to help answer questions such as:
   - How many occupants who lost their lives in a traffic accident were unrestrained?
   - Are occupants of larger, heavier vehicles more protected in certain crashes?
   - How do safety outcomes vary by year, region, or driver demographics?
